RestaurantManager is a Java-based application designed to streamline communication between restaurant clients and staff. By automating order and receipt processes,
the app enhances interaction frequency and efficiency. Clients can place orders directly through the app, which then relays the information to the kitchen and waitstaff in real-time.
This automation reduces wait times, minimizes errors, and ensures a smoother dining experience. Additionally, the app generates digital receipts, simplifying billing and payment processes.
RestaurantManager ultimately aims to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in the restaurant industry.
